# Google Data Analytics Professional Capstone : Case Study
Capstone project from the Coursera certification "Google Data Analytics Professional"


## Cyclistic 2024: Bike & E-Scooter Usage Analysis

### Google Data Analytics Capstone

This project is my capstone for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.
Instead of working with only the previous 12 months of raw data (year 2024, from January until December), I extended the project by:

Handling the introduction of e-scooters in mid-2024

Performing full data cleaning, transformation, and visualization

Following the official data analysis cycle: Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act

### Business Objective

Cyclistic wants to increase the number of annual members.
To support a new marketing strategy, this analysis compares how casual riders and annual members use:

Classic bikes

Electric bikes

Newly introduced electric scooters

### Key Insights

- Members ride more during weekdays and for commuting
- More casual riders during weekends and for longer leisure rides
- Scooters attract new casual users but show little adoption among members
- Membership-focused campaigns should target:
  - evening/weekend riders
  - scooter-first users
  - high-traffic tourist zones


### Tools & Skills Used

SQL for EDA/Cleaning and Processing (BigQuery)

Python for EDA (Pandas, Matplotlib)

Data Cleaning (handling nulls, merging 12 monthly datasets)

Feature Engineering (ride length, day of week, ride type)

Data Visualization

Business analytics and recommendation writing
